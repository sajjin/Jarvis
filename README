# Jarvis application

This application is a google assistant like app that I developed for my computer. It had many features like:

1. google searches
2. opening links in a websearch
3. opening and closeing applications
4. playing music
5. playing videos
6. tell the weather
7. multiple commands in one sentence

This current version is still in development, so it will run in the command line.

# How to use

downlaod all the dependencies and run the application.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```shell
python jarvis.py
```
